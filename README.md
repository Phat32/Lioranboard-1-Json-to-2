# Lioranboard-1-Json-to-2
A WPF tool to convert the exported JSON from Lioranboard 1 to the format used in Lioranboard 2

Super simple still a work in progress tool. Export your button from LB1 and paste it into the top box, press the button and the converted LB2 JSON will be output in the bottom box.

There are still errors that happen and things not fully implemented yet, but they should be finished in the next day or 2.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
- Deck Switching from the button
- Drag Press
